# Gringotts

Gringotts is a fictional bank (no, not just in Harry Potter, in this here git repo too!).
It's a demo app to show a range of security and DevOps concepts in a working app.

## Demos

There are a lot of things to demo, I try to list examples here, with links to relevant code snippets.
Examples fall into three main categories;

1. Python development
2. DevOps things - making deployment better / easier
3. Security things - making the app more secure

processes and infrastructure to be modern, secure and resillient.

I use this project as a "visual aid" for training, examples and talks.
