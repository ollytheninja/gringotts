# Gringotts

Bringing the fictional bank from Harry Potter to [gringotts.online](https://gringotts.online/). 
(There's nothing there yet!)

This project is a demo app to show a range of DevOps / Security / Infra as Code / automation concepts in a working app.

It's largely based on my opinion and what I think is the best way to do things but I am far from perfect.
Things change, new tools come along, and I update this project when I see a better way to do something!
I welcome Issues and PRs to fix things or employ better techniques.

## Demos

There are a lot of things to demo, I try to list examples here, with links to relevant code snippets.
Examples fall into three main categories;

1. Python development
2. DevOps things - making deployment better / easier
3. Security things - making the app more secure


## About me

Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Olly, 
I'm a Cloud Native Engineer working in the DevOps and Security space,
helping organisations secure their data by helping them improve 
processes and infrastructure to be modern, secure and resillient.

I use this project as a "visual aid" for training, examples and talks.
Any contributions, discussions or questions are welcome, I'm always keen to learn new things!

Please raise an issue or PR.
